 ---------------------------
Implement a Karel function named "backup" that has the effect of
moving Karel backward one square but leaves it facing in the same direction.

If Karelâ€™s back is against a wall, the backup function should fail when Karel tries
to execute the move instruction that is part of the implementation.

import "turns";

function backup() {
	move();
 turnAround();
 move();
 turnAround();
}
